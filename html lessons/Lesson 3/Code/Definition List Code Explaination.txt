		Definition List Code Explaination

<dl>

The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
<dd> elements.

<dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).

<dd>
This is used to contain the
definition.

Sometimes you might see a list
where there are two terms used
for the same definition or two
different definitions for the same
term.
