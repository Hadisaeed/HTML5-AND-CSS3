This lesson is all About Links

Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

You will commonly come across the following types of links:

1.Links from one website to another
2.Links from one page to another on the same website
3.Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
4.Links that open in a new browser window
5.Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The text between the opening
<a> tag and closing </a> tag
is known as link text.


Absolute URL:

When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.


Relative URL:

When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.



Relative paths

a.gif -> same directory
../a.gif -> parent directory

images/a.gif ->sub-directory called images

../images/a.gif -> parent directory's

images floder

../../images/a.gif -> parent's parent 
directory's images floder

why relative paths?

ever need to move the directory structure?

ever need to migrate from local development to a web 
server
