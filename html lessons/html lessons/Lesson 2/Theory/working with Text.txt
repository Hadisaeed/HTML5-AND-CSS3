In this Lesson we focus on how to add markup to the text that
appears on your pages. we learn about:


Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs

for Example:

<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>

<p>

<b>

<i>

<sup>

<sub>

<br>

<hr>


Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

for example:

<strong>

<em>

<blockquote>

<q>

<abbr>

<cite>

<dfn>

<address>

<ins>

<del>

<s>
