In Lesson 2a
we use 7 tags

1.<p>

To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.

2.<b>

By enclosing words in the tags
<b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.
The <b> element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the <b> element does not imply
any additional meaning.

3.<i>
By enclosing words in the tags
<i> and </i> we can make
characters appear italic.
The <i> element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content — such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.

4.<sup>

The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 2^2.

5.<sub>

The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.

6.<br>

As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag <br>.

7.<hr>

To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the <hr> tag.
