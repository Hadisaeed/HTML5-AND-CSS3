In lesson 2b 
we see the following tags

1.<strong>

The use of the <strong>
element indicates that its
content has strong importance.
For example, the words
contained in this element might
be said with strong emphasis.

By default, browsers will show
the contents of a <strong>
element in bold.

2.<em>

The <em> element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.

By default browsers will show
the contents of an <em> element
in italic.

3.<blockquote>

The <blockquote> element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. Note
how the <p> element is still
used inside the <blockquote>
element.

Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the <blockquote>
element, however you should not
use this element just to indent a
piece of text — rather you should
achieve this effect using CSS.

4.<q>

The <q> element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are
supposed to put quotes around
the <q> element, however
Internet Explorer does not —
therefore many people avoid
using the <q> element.

Both elements may use the cite
attribute to indicate where the
quote is from. Its value should
be a URL that will have more
information about the source of
the quotation.

5.<abbr> 

If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the <abbr>
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.
In HTML 4 there was a separate

6.<acronym> element for
acronyms. To spell out the full
form of the acronym, the title
attribute was used (as with the
<abbr> element above). HTML5
just uses the <abbr> element
for both abbreviations and
acronyms.

7.<cite>

When you are referencing a
piece of work such as a book,
film or research paper, the
<cite> element can be used
to indicate where the citation is
from.

In HTML5, <cite> should not
really be used for a person's
name — but it was allowed in
HTML 4, so most people are
likely to continue to use it.

Browsers will render the content
of a <cite> element in italics.

8.<dfn>

The first time you explain some
new terminology (perhaps an
academic concept or some
jargon) in a document, it is
known as the defining instance
of it.

The <dfn> element is used to
indicate the defining instance of
a new term.

Some browsers show the
content of the <dfn> element in
italics. Safari and Chrome do not
change its appearance.

9.<address> 

The <address> element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.

It can contain a physical address,
but it does not have to. For
example, it may also contain a
phone number or email address.
Browsers often display the
content of the <address>
element in italics.

You may also be interested in
something called the hCard
microformat for adding physical
address information to your
markup.

10.<ins> Or <del>

The <ins> element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while

the <del> element can show text
that has been deleted from it.

The content of a <ins> element
is usually underlined, while the
content of a <del> element
usually has a line through it.

11.<s>

The <s> element indicates
something that is no longer
accurate or relevant (but that
should not be deleted).

Visually the content of an <s>
element will usually be displayed
with a line through the center.
