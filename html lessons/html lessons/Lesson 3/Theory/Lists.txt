		Lists


There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:

1.Ordered lists

Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

2.Unordered lists

Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

3.Definition lists

Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
