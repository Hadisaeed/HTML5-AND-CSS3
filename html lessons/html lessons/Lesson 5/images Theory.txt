In This Lesson We discuss Images

To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:

1.src

This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.

2.alt

This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

3.title

You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.


other Attributes:
height
width
align values->top,bottom,middle,left,right


New Html5 Attributes

<figure>

Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the <figure>
element as long as they all share
the same caption.

<figcaption>

The <figcaption> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an <img> element with
its caption.
