In this Lesson we discuss on the following topic:

1. What Css does?
2. How Css works?
3. Rules,properties and values


*	"Css stand for cascading style sheet"

*	Css allows you to create rules that specify
	how the content of an element should appear.

*	The key to understanding how Css works is to
	imagine that there is an invisible box around
	every HTML element.

*	A css rule contains two parts
	1. A selector.
	2. A declaration.

*	Selector indicate which element the rule applies to.

*	Declaration indicates how the elements reffered to
	in the selector should be styled.

*	Css declaration sit inside curly brackets and each made 
	up of two parts:
	1. A Propery
	2. A value
	Seperated by a colon.You can specify several properties
	in one declaration each seperated by a semi-colon.

*	The <link> element can be used in an Html document to
	tell the browser where to find the Css file used to 
	style the page.It should use three attributes.

	1. href
		This Specifies the path to Css file.

	2. type
		This attribute specifies the type of document
		being linked to.The value should be text/css.
	3. rel
		This specifies the relationship between the Html
		page and file it is linked to.The value Should
		be Stylesheet when linking to a css file.

*	You can also include Css Rules Within an HTML Page
	by placing them inside a <style> element.Which is Usually
	sits inside the <head> element of the page.

*	There are many different types of Css selector that
	allow you to target rules to specifies elements in an
	HTML document.

*	Css selectors are Case Sensitive so they must match
	element names and attributes values exactly.
