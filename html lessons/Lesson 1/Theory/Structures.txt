In order to learn how to write web-pages it is very important
to understand how to structure your document.so in this  lesson we discuss
the basic structure of a HTML Document.

	HTML stands for "Hyper Text Mark up Language".

	HTML pages are text documents.


	HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
	bracket, these are called HTML Elements.

	Elements are Usually made up Of two tags:	
	An Opening Tag.
	A closing Tag.

	Each HTML elements tells the browser somthing about the
	information that sits between its Opening and closing tags.

	HTML uses tags to give the information they surrond special
	meaning.

	Tags Usually come in pairs.The opening tag denotes the start
	of a piece of content.The closing tag denotes the end.

	Oening tags can carry attributes which tell us more about the c
	content of that element.

	Attributes provides additional information about the contents
	of an elements.They appear on the opening  tag of the element 
	are made up of two part
	1.Name
	2.value
	Separted by an equal sign.
	
	The attribute name indicates what type of extra information
	you are supplying about the element's content.It should be written
	in lower case.

	The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It
	should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes can
	have different values.

	for example:

	<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>


	Here an attribute called lang is used to indicate the language
	used in this element. The value of this attribute on this page
	specifies it is in US English.
