<!DOCTYPE html> that means...

The world that you are creating in html5 document



Every html page is composed of two part
1. the head
2. the body

Body, Head & Title

<body>

You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.

<head>

Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.

<title>

The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time.

HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
<h3> element is used, and so
on...


<P> tag is use for paragraph.

In paragraph opening tag there is a 
attribute name = lang and its value is = "en-us"
it means that the language of this paragraph is
US-english.
