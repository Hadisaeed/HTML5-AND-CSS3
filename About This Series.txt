Why this Series?

Html5 and css3 is used to build web and (soon) windows
user interfaces... increasingly important!

Goals for this Series...

1. Build an example of a real HTML5 and CSS3 web pages.
2. Learn the semantics behind many HTML5 tags
3. Learn the geeky details.
4. Separation of Concerns between content and presentation.
5. CSS selectors, Properties, Syntax, etc.

My Approach or Goals

	Focus on structure, semantics,technical details
of CSS etc.Not How to Make "Pretty web Pages".

Developer's perspective (as Opposed to a Graphic designer's
perspective).

Not a reference Document,many of these exit already on 
the web.


Which Tools Will We Use?

you can use any tool but my aim is to make this series
accessible to as many people as possible.. therefore...

1. Windows notepad

2. internet Explorer 9.0(or greater) .

To Make the most of it from this please try to become active
learner type the examples.
Be focused.

Thank You.....
